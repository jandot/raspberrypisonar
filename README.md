= Raspberry Pi sonar

Having bought a sit/stand desk, we want to log the height that the desk is at. This will give us an idea if I'm using the desk as it should or if I start to lag after a while.

Initial code ultrasonic_2.py based on http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/01/ultrasonic-distance-measurement-using-python-part-2/

== Todo

* Only have this run during the day
* Next step: only have this run when I'm actually behind my desk (e.g. using separate sonar pointing towards me)
